# Proposal 
## Number Guesser 
### Description and Motivation
In this project, we want to build a random generating guessing game. Our game is going to consist of multiple levels that get harder as the game progresses. We will also include lives which are going to determine the amount of tries the player gets to guess in each level. We will provide hints to help the player get closer to the correct number. If the player guesses 'Correct' a life will be added to the next level. However, the player only has three lives at the beggining of the game. If their guess is incorrect, a life will be taken away. If the lives reaches '0', the game will show the player the correct number. We are motivated to create a simple game for the user to play while including a lot of complex steps amoung the way. 

### Prior Art 
We used a website that gave examples of different coding projects for inspiration. The game will have a similar code to a rock paper scissors game or tic tac toe using while loops and if statements.

### Core User Workflows:
- **Play Number Guessing Game:** The user should be able to play the guessing game and be given hints on attempting to guess the number correct. 
- **Progress through levels:** If the user guesses the correct number with the amount of lives provided they should be able to move on to a more complex level. 
- **Lives:** The user should be given three lives at the start of the initial game. If they cannot guess the number with 3 lives it will be "Game Over." If the user gets the      number correct, the lives will transfor and add one for winning that level. 
- **Hints:** The game will display hints for the user to have a better chance at guessing the number correctly. For example, "Incorrect, Too Low" or "Incorrect, Too High".
- **Win or Lose** The user will be given a message at the end of the game displaying whether they "Won" or "Incorrect, Game Over". 
### Daily Goals
Tuesday: We should be able to create the outline of the code. That includes focusing on the user progressing through each of the levels and the correct code used to create the levels and how to go through them.

Wednesday: We'll add the more complicated bits of the code to pull the project together. This means adding a chance every time the user goes up a level, adding a bigger range of numbers for each level, different types of hints (what the number is divisible by, go higher or lower, etc)

Thursday: We will clean up any unnecessary code, and rewrite some if its needed, add the final messages to the end of the project that inform the user whether they win or lose, and test the project multiple times to make sure we're satisfied with it.
