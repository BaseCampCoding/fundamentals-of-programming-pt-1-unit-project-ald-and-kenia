# Proposal 
## Number Guesser 
### Description and Motivation
In this project, we want to build a random generating guessing game. Our game is going to consist of multiple levels that get harder as the game progresses. We will also include lives which are going to determine the amount of tries the user gets to guess in each level. We will provide hints to help the user get closer to the correct number. If the user guesses "Correct" a life will be added to the next level. However, the user only has three lives at the beggining of the game. If their guess is incorrect, a life will be taken away. If the lives reaches "0", the game will show the user the correct number. 

### Core User Workflows
- **Play Number Guessing Game:** The user should be able to play the guessing game and be given hints on attempting to guess the number correct. 
- **Progress through levels:** If the user guesses the correct number with the amount of lives provided they should be able to move on to a more complex level. 
- **Lives:** The user should be given three lives at the start of the initial game. If they cannot guess the number with 3 lives it will be "Game Over." If the user gets the      number correct, the lives will transfor and add one for winning that level. 
- **Win or Lose** The user will be given a message at the end of the game displaying whether they "Won" or "Incorrect, Game Over".
