# Proposal 
## Number Guesser 
### Description and Motivation
In this project, we want to build a random generating guessing game. Our game is going to consist of multiple levels that get harder as the game progresses. We will also include lives which are going to determine the amount of tries the player gets to guess in each level. We will provide hints to help the player get closer to the correct number. If the player guesses 'Correct' a life will be added to the next level. However, the player only has three lives at the beggining of the game. If their guess is incorrect, a life will be taken away. If the lives reaches '0', the game will show the player the correct number. 

#### Prior Art 
We used a website that gave examples of different coding projects for inspiration. The game will have a similar code to a rock paper scissors game or tic tac toe using while loops and if statements.


##### Daily Goals
Tuesday: We should be able to create the outline of the code. That includes allowing the user to progress through levels, have multiple chances to guess the right number, start over when they lose, and win the game.

Wednesday: We'll add the more complicated bits of the code to pull the project together. This means adding a chance every time the user goes up a level, adding a bigger range of numbers for each level, different types of hints (what the number is divisible by, go higher or lower, etc)

Thursday: We will clean up any unnecessary code, and rewrite some if its needed, and add any final details to the project, and test the project multiple times to make sure we're satisfied with it.
