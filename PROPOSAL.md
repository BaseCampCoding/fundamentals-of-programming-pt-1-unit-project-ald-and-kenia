# Proposal 
## Number Guesser 
### Description and Motivation
In this project, we want to build a random generating guessing game. Our game is going to consist of multiple levels that get harder as the game progresses. We will also include lives which are going to determine the amount of tries the player gets to guess in each level. We will provide hints to help the player get closer to the correct number. If the player guesses 'Correct' a life will be added to the next level. However, the player only has three lives at the beggining of the game. If their guess is incorrect, a life will be taken away. If the lives reaches '0', the game will show the player the correct number.
