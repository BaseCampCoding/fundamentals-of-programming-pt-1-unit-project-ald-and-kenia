# Proposal 
## Number Guesser 
### Description and Motivation
In this project, we want to build a random generating guessing game. Our game is going to consist of multiple levels that get harder as the game progresses. We will also include lives which are going to determine the amount of tries the player gets to guess in each level. We will provide hints to help the player get closer to the correct number. If the player guesses 'Correct' a life will be added to the next level. However, the player only has three lives at the beggining of the game. If their guess is incorrect, a life will be taken away. If the lives reaches '0', the game will show the player the correct number. 

### Prior Art 
We used a website that gave examples of different coding projects for inspiration. The game will have a similar code to a rock paper scissors game or tic tac toe using while loops and if statements.

### Core User Workflows:

### Daily Goals
Tuesday: We should be able to create the outline of the code. That includes focusing on the user progressing through each of the levels and the correct code used to create the levels and how to go through them. By the end of the day the user should be able to go through each level when they guess the correct number.

Wednesday: We'll add the more complicated bits of the code to pull the project together. This means adding a chance every time the user goes up a level, adding a bigger range of numbers for each level, different types of hints (what the number is divisible by, go higher or lower, etc) The levels should be more complicated for the user, and they should see the hints, and have an extra chance to guess.

Thursday: We will clean up any unnecessary code, and rewrite some if its needed, add the final messages to the end of the project that inform the user whether they win or lose, and test the project multiple times to make sure we're satisfied with it. The project should be complete by the end of Thursday and the user should be able to finish the entire game or start over when they lose.
